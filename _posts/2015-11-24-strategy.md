Lean Six Sigma execution

Our highly experienced consultants apply Lean Six Sigma methodologies and execution skills to projects as a stand-alone or integrated service, in parallel with broader transformation initiatives or as part of a specific issue based deployment. In addition, some struggle with dedicating sufficient full-time resources to achieve the breakthrough results that Lean Six Sigma is capable of delivering. Our experienced resources can be brought in on a short-term basis to jump-start profitability or to supplement areas of the business where resources are tightly constrained.

Rapid improvement & Kaizen

Our proprietary speed+quality=results  project selection and prioritization approach helps clients focus their efforts on the most promising organizational improvement opportunities. It is designed to engage all levels of the organization to effect a change in culture that embraces process excellence. When integrated with Lean Kaizen clients are able to achieve unprecedented speed+quality=results and organizational superiority.

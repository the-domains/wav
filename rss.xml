            <title><![CDATA[Corporate Structuring]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Corporate Structuring</h1><p>These are uncertain times—fluid at best, turbulent too often. Yes, there are wonderful opportunities at home and abroad for smart and well-informed companies; but there are also many difficulties to be managed, simply in the course of doing business.

How effective are your technology systems and do they support your business operations and activities? Do you have timely access to reliable and accurate business and financial information to base your decisions upon?

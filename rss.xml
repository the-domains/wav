            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Technology</h1><p>Your organizations’ approach to technology may be at the heart of your success or failure. How effective are your technology systems and do they support your business operations and activities? Do you have timely access to reliable and accurate business and financial information to base your decisions upon? Most firms struggle to make the best decisions for their business in this area because technology is always changing and the level of investment dollars required for change can be daunting.   At Green Wave we find the answers to those questions and more.
